# Anzen Packages

Standalone updateable core packages for Anzen.

Repository does not need to be built with the `tsc` command, 
Cores are placed within `/src/packages` so they get built with the project.

Packages are also imported from The `/src` directory so no need to use a `index.ts` file in `/src/packages`
